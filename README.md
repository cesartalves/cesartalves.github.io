# One website to rule them all

## [cesartalvez.com](https://cesartalvez.com)

Because linktree was simply not doing the job anymore (according to the Digital Marketing fellas)

Decided to get my hands dirty and do a website from scratch. No frameworks, no hassle, no anything.

## Did you Design this website yourself?

Partially. I used a lot of AI, although I wrote some parts from scratch and, obviously, had to edit a lot of stuff by hand.

## Can I use this template?

Of course! Just pretend this is your homework from school and hm, don't make it too obvious that you copied it ;)

## Can you teach me how to Program?

Yeah. See "Lessons on the Website

## Can you teach me English, Japanese, Portuguese?

Probably. See "Lessons" on the Website

## Can you teach me X, Y, Z?

If you're asking this, you probably have stalked me enough to think I am pretty decent at that, so yeah! :)
